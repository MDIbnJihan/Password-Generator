Password is a simple portable application for Windows which does not require any installation. This application can generate passwords at maximum 64 characters long. Password generator has a simple UI to use. It is compatible with Windows 7 or higher. I have tested this application on Windows 7.

It is written using C# and Microsoft .NET for Desktop frameowrk also implementing Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This application is a lite application and also has low memory usage.

I developed this application as a part of my project when I was learning C# and WPF. I love coding challenges and challenging myself at new levels. I enjoy it. Though, it was an easy application to build, I learned a lot of things and also applied my learning through the journey.

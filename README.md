# Password-Generator
I tried to create a simple password generator application for Windows operating system.
This is a fun project. It should not be used as a commercial or other type of uses.
The code is open to public as anyone can copy or modify the codes.
This Windows application is made using C#, XAML, .NET Framework.
This application can run on Windows XP/ Vista/ 7/ 8.1/ 10/ 11.
For runnning the application, .NET Framework 3.1 (LTS) or higher must be installed on the system.
